### Description

In-progress custom portfolio page built to practice CSS animations and responsive design. This web page is meant to outlines my personal web development proficiencies, as well as my past graphic design and video production projects.

### Gif Example

### Features
This project contains:
- A custom nav animated menu
- Clickable video content
- Responsiveness to viewport size
- Custom Javascript code to correctly time CSS animations and avoid UI bugs.

### Roadmap
This project is not yet finished. It still needs:
- Finalized phone view designs for full responsiveness.
- Finalized text copy and images for 'comms + design'
- All content for 'about-me' section needs to be added
- Functional sub-menu buttons for animations and navigating between sections
- 'cursor: pointer' or 'cursor: default' css rules for all clickable content.
- Refactored SCSS code. Current code is very repetitive and not DRY enough
- Live links
- Deployment to custom URL address
